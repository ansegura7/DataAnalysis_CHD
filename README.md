# Keras: Regression with Neural Networks
Project that performs the regression of a continuous variable (oil) from a set of associated variables. The Keras framework is used to easily create a TensorFlow Neural Network.

# Data
The dataset used is made up of a group of operational and PVT variables for oil wells.
